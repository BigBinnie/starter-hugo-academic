Hi! I'm a gap year student. Recently, I received my B.Eng. degree from the Department of Software Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I'm working as an intern in [X-LANCE Lab](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en) of SJTU, coadvised by Prof. [Mengyue Wu](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en/members/mengyue-wu), Prof. [Lu Chen](https://coai-sjtu.github.io/), and Prof. [Kai Yu](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en/members/kai_yu). Our previous work mainly focuses on the dialogue system for depression diagnosis.

I'm super interested in natural language processing, especially the dialogue system. Additionally, I love coding and bringing cute applications to the world.

Currently, I'm looking for a PhD position in 2023 Spring/Fall.
