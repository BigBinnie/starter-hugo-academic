Hi! I'm an incoming PhD student at Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison. Currently，I'm a visiting student at [SALT](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/group.html) lab，coadvised by Prof. [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/index.html) from Stanford Univeristy and Prof. [Junjie Hu](https://junjiehu.github.io/) from Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison.

I received my B.Eng. degree from the Department of Software Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I'm working as an intern in [X-LANCE Lab](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en) of SJTU, coadvised by Prof. [Mengyue Wu](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en/members/mengyue-wu), Prof. [Lu Chen](https://coai-sjtu.github.io/), and Prof. [Kai Yu](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en/members/kai_yu). Our work mainly focuses on the dialogue system for depression diagnosis.

I have broad research interests including natural language processing, multi-modality interaction and data management. More specially, I'm enthusiastic about research topics which have a positive impact on the society such as [NLP for Social Good](https://nlp4sg.vercel.app/), and topics which try to integrate sociology and psychology to create more informative and empathetic machine learning models. 

Additionally, I love coding and bringing cute applications to the world.
